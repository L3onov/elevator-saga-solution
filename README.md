## Solution

The following is the implementation content.

### Basic

* The information that the button of the floor was pressed is kept as floor Ã— direction (up or down).
    * Move a nearby stop elevator.
    * Once it stops on that floor, clear the information.
    * Check the information before passing through the floor, stop on the floor if the same button as the traveling direction is pressed and the passenger can still ride.
    * When the destination floor disappears, move to the floor closest to the current floor on the floor where the button was pressed.
* When the destination floor button in the elevator is pushed, reset the order in which it stops on the floor to the optimum order.

### Advanced

* From the destination candidate, exclude the floor where another elevator is about to stop next.
* At the timing when the passenger passes through the floor, if the passenger is 0, the movement destination is re-determined with the latest information.
* In Challenge #6 #7, move a lot of people on board.
